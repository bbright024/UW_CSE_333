University of Washington CSE 333 - Systems Programming 

These are practice problems in C and C++, as given by 

https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse333/16su/calendar/hwlist.html

Solutions are included when the problem itself was difficult; for pure practice stuff
I didn't bother.


Ex0 - examining different pitfalls of implementing reccurences by calculating pi using the 
	nilakantha infinite series.  Discovered stack overflow using recursion, fixed by using
	a while loop instead of recursive calls.  Discovered integer overflow, fixed by
	changing the type to unsigned long int. 

Ex1 - implementing insertion sort and selection sort in c with unsigned long ints.
	nothing too interesting, but it was helpful to get more practice on sorts.

Ex2 - printed out byte values of different types of variables by taking their sizeof value 
	and using the pointer to the variable to print out bytes at that location in memory.

Ex3 - simple, allocated a struct with 3 variables and freed at the end.
